This is Benjamin Nesbit's Profesional Repository

This Repository was started as a project for CS160 at Orgeon State University in Bend, OR.
It contains a zombie outbreak simulator, that is still a work in progress. It will always have the most
	current version of the Zombulator.
It also contains the most current version of my resume.





And a button that will randomly link to one of my favorite places to get a burrito.
